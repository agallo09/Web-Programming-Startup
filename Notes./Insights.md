I will use this page to write down the thoughts during the process, kind of a journal
The purpose is to try to define my thinking model after the final project
# Part 1: Goal, Prototype
When I first started the project I wanted to create a social website, CampusCollab
The idea was to make a space where student from universities all over theworld could post the projects they were doing in their own.
Other students would find projects that appeal to them and try to find a way to collaborate.

I changed my mind and decided that I wanted to create a website where the center goal was not collaboration, but managing projects.
ProjectManager, a website where people could manage their personal and team projects, only these two modes. Big part of the bases of this idea were inspired by Trello.

Later, talking with Chatgpt to brainstorm ideas and iterating through a lot of pages I found this beautiful site calles behance.
Behance is a Adove website where designer create portfolios, open resources for any user. This made me think of the portfolio pages.
Most of this websites help you create a personal website or help you design a folder. 

Two weeks ago I was sending my applications to some internships for next summer, most of them ask for a Personal website.
The link that most applicants paste on that part is their linkedin link. Linkedin, a special website, lets you create a some kind of portfolio and connect with others based on that.
This goal made me come up with the question, what if I list a project on my linkedin an someon wants to work on it with me? 

This question made me decide the goal of my project, and define the final prototype of my web: PortfolioCollab.

PortfolioCollab, its basically a combination of the best parts of each of the named websites.
Behance: create the portfolio, and find others works
Linkedin: Find people , and show not only your work but what makes you a three dimentional person: interests, extracurriculars,etc.
CampusCollab: the feature of connecting with other students, not only for commoon interests as the field, but as a common goal: Collaborate in projects
ProjectManager/ Trello: the feature of managing projects at all levels, and designating tasks, sharing control.
