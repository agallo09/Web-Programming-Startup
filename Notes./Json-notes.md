## JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) was conceived by Douglas Crockford in 2001 while working at Yahoo! JSON, pronounced like the name Jason, received official standardization in 2013 and 2017 (ECMA-404, [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)).

JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.
Here is an example of a JSON document.

```json
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```
### Converting to JavaScript

You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.

```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```
